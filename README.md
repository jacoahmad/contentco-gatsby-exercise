### About

This repository is to test for some common scenarios that we have with our marketing site.  In this test you will put together a demo site using [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) in the time provided to you from our call. Clone this repository to your local machine and push to your own github respository. **Do not create a fork.**

### What we're looking for

The site must contain the following:
1) Article pages generated by a REST API. Use [this example](https://www.techinasia.com/wp-json/techinasia/2.0/posts?page=1&per_page=10) for your endpoint.
2) An article list homepage. This homepage should contain all of the generated article pages.
3) A react dropdown filter component for the list on the homepage.
4) Meet the simple design spec [for the list](https://sketch.cloud/s/OOaov/wLxKx5D) and [for the detail](https://sketch.cloud/s/OOaov/qeADAby).

### How to submit

The resulting site should be placed in a public github repository with the build in a docs folder with github pages enabled for easy viewing. And then provide us the link to view.
