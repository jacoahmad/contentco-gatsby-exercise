Here's a job description template to help you call for the content strategist you are looking for. Feel free to edit it to best suit your needs. To assess potential candidates, do also check out our hiring guide for content strategists, as well as interview questions you might use.


## Company Introduction

This is where you make one of the first impressions with prospective hires. You want to share a concise and memorable paragraph about your company and what candidates can expect from working with your team.

Here’s some information to include in your company introduction:
- Product and service offerings
- Company size
- Key clients
- Company’s mission & goals
 
 Tip: While you want to excite the candidate with highlights of your company, refrain from painting an unrealistic picture of your company or you may attract candidates for the wrong reasons.

## Alternate Job Titles

> The title that you decide to list for the position will attract different types of candidates. A ‘Content Strategist’s primary role is championing the brand-oriented editorial direction for the blog, while roles like ‘Digital Brand Specialist’, ‘Marketing Data Analyst’ and ‘Social Media/SEO Strategist’ may bring more specific but related skill sets to the table. 


### Content Strategist vs Digital Brand Specialist

Digital Brand Specialists produce photos, videos, branding collaterals, infographics and other related visual content that strengthens your brand’s storytelling strength. They may also take charge of the brand’s creative direction, and work with freelancers to produce the required assets for marketing purposes. These candidates are expected to be familiar with the Adobe Suite.

### Content Strategist vs Marketing Data Analyst

Marketing Data Analysts are integral in leveraging content analytics to develop marketing strategy, and are in turn responsible for optimising existing assets and producing sharper campaigns as a result. While a Content Strategist is responsible for ensuring the delivery of content assets, the Marketing Data Analyst’s role is more specific, in particular with the ability to derive the ROI on content production. 

### Content Strategist vs Social Media/SEO Strategist

While a Content Strategist may be a more general role that produces content across all the company’s channels, Social Media or SEO Strategists would be more familiar with producing and editing content specific to those two areas. Social Media Strategists may also play a role in community management, and SEO Strategists may also hold SEO marketing responsibilities.
