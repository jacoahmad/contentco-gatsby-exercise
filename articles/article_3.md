Here are some interview questions you can consider when interviewing and assessing candidates for a content strategist role. For more information on how to hire a content strategist, check out our hiring guide and our job description template.

## How would you measure if a piece of content is doing well? What would you consider a good piece of content? 

> Average Candidate: “I think content that is interesting is good, it might even go viral. If people think the content is interesting, the brand will be popular and they will want to buy your product. You can easily tell whether a piece of content is doing well if many people like it.”

vs 

> Great Candidate: “Content that appeals to the target audience and has some return on lead generation or increase in brand awareness is good and effective content. There are several metrics to look at in measuring whether a piece of content is doing well. Depending on your business goals, a company may look at page views, search engine ranking or number of clicks on a page. 100 likes from your target audience may even be better than 200 likes from a general audience.”

A weak answer would not identify metrics that matter, and will also fail to see the bigger picture of content strategy, instead focusing on the content itself. A better answer would include mentions of metrics that are more related to business strategy, which means they can write and edit with those goals in mind. Keywords include ‘inform and engage’ readers, SEO-related terms, page views, clicks, lead generation, brand awareness. 

## What kind of content do you enjoy? What is one of your favourite examples of a company who is doing content strategy right? What do you want to see for content in this industry? 

> Average Candidate: “I like the content this company produces because it’s very interesting and engaging. I can finish watching the video/finish reading the article to the end, and it’s very on-brand. I think the content in this industry is too safe and boring, and people like me don’t want to watch/read it.”

vs

> Great Candidate: “I like the content this company produces because it really appeals to their target audience. If you look briefly at their likes on social media or on the comments on their articles, they’re made up of the demographics of their target audience. The content might be a bit boring or corporate for some people, but clearly, it works to get their brand message out to the right people. I noticed they have certain templates for the way their content is formatted, and while this helps to improve turnover time, it does get repetitive over time. I think it’s definitely possible to come up with more series for more variety in content formats, as well as experiment with multimedia to illustrate their points better.”

This is a more industry-specific version of the question above. They should discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the content producer they like. A weaker answer would only focus on whether or not they found the content interesting. A stronger answer would discuss the quality of the content, considering that they may not be the target audience, and instead focus on whether the overall strategy helps to reach any business goals in its production and distribution. This also gives you a glimpse into the ideas they have, and whether they have a grasp of the content needs of companies in your industry.
