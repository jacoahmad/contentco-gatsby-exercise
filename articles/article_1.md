Consumer banking is an industry rich with transactional and demographic data: what we spend on says a lot about who we are. However, the difficulty of cross-team collaboration and the highly regulated nature of financial institutions has made it challenging for banks to serve their customers better with this rich trove of behavioural knowledge.

### Analytics Is Everyone’s Job

Gupta emphasises that opportunities and insights from data analytics cannot be unlocked if analytics teams are not a part of the ownership of the business problems posed to them by their colleagues.

#### Before: Data Team as a Service Center

“Traditionally, like most banking organisations, DBS’s organisational structure for data analytics used to function like a service centre,” he says. Whenever key stakeholders such as the customer segment teams or product teams had a business problem, they would translate it into a data problem. The data request would then be sent to the analytics team. Issues with this model are that the problem statement may not be consistently shared with the analytics team, and the analytics team then has a limited view of what the actual problem is. They will generally focus on the data requests and provide the data and report on it.

Gupta points out this is a very reactive model:

- The focus of the analytics team is on the data request.
- There is limited potential for higher level analytics like predictive and prescriptive analytics.
- The full expertise of the analytics team is not utilised.
- There is a long turnaround time because you service the data based on your interpretation, resulting in multiple rounds of reworking needed.

#### After: The 2-in-a-box model

Recognising the challenges faced by traditional banks, Gupta introduced the 2-in-a-box framework to his analytics team earlier this year to guide their interactions with other functions within the bank.

)

The 2-in-a-box model allows for collective leadership where two leaders with different areas of expertise approach the same goals. How this model is designed to work is to assign an analytics team to a product or segment team facing a problem. For example, Gupta’s team now owns the same KPIs as their product or segment stakeholders. They would sit in for the business teams’ meetings to understand their team’s operational processes and business objectives. They then function as a communication conduit to help understand their problems better.

While the analytics team remains separate by organisation structure, they are deeply embedded within their stakeholders’ teams with whom they work very closely. So much so that he quipped, “sometimes the engagement with stakeholder teams is even higher than within their own teams”. It helps the problem solver to identify with and experience the problem alongside the product and business owner. The analytics owner is empowered to formulate the business problem into a data problem much more precisely.
