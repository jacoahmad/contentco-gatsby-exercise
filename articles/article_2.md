As a provider of technology that empowers designers, engineers, makers and builders, Autodesk's vision focuses on the future of making and their goal is to help people make anything.

Through their online publication Redshift, Autodesk continues to articulate its vision of being at the forefront of innovation. And the man behind Redshift is Autodesk’s Head of Content Marketing and Social Media, Dusty DiMercurio, who is also the publication's Editorial Director. He and his team are responsible for the high-quality content on Redshift that keeps customers coming back for more.

Known initially as Line//Shape//Space, a blog targeting small businesses, Redshift has now grown to become a multi-award-winning publication that focuses on the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC), manufacturing, and media and entertainment industries. Since its rebrand, the publication functions as an owned media channel for Autodesk, reporting stories and happenings across the industries they serve. With an editorial charter focused on the future of making, Redshift features stories of their most innovative customers as well as thought leadership topics geared towards the industries that Autodesk reaches.

The term industry experts is a broad one. According to DiMercurio, here are the distinct groups of experts Autodesk’s content marketing team works with:

Internal subject matter experts and technologists who act as consultants to Autodesk customers. These experts often have years of operational experience in their relevant fields.
- Journalists, writers and editors who cover manufacturing, infrastructure, construction and architecture beats.
- Visionaries or thought leaders in relevant industries. They are often the ones at the centre of Redshift’s stories.
- Content series featuring visionaries and, or experts in Autodesk’s relevant industries.

### Allowing industry experts to drive the ideation process

Autodesk’s products and solutions cut across distinct industries (manufacturing, construction, gaming, automotive, and architecture, to name a few), with exciting conversations in each vertical. Redshift’s editorial team faces the challenge of selecting and publishing the right stories for the right audiences.

It is vital that Redshift is established as an authority figure in the industries and sectors that utilise Autodesk’s products. To get a deeper understanding of these industries, the team turned to experts within the company. “Some stories are popular because they resonate specifically with their intended audiences. We’ve been successful in reaching those audiences, and they share the stories with their friends and colleagues,” said DiMercurio.

With so many moving parts, we wanted to find out how Redshift streamlines their creative process to get the best stories from all across the company.
